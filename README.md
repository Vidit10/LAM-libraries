# LAM Research Round-02 Libraries with Examples

## Temperature Sensor - DS18B20
This measures the temperature using the DS18B20 sensor, the only library used is the OneWire.h, which I am assuming to be a bare metal library, because it is used for one wire communication.

## OLED Display
A 128x64 bit display coded from scratch, used to display the required temperature, updated live as the rotary encoder is rotated and the button gets pressed.

## Rotary Encoder
- Rotation - clockwise or anti-clockwise
- Button being pressed is used to lock the required temperature.
